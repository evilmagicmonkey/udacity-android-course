    <string name="homes_description_1">The name of this house is the result of a popular, and rather
        cruel, children\'s rhyme, which likened its occupant with a hideous creature. The object of
        their ridicule was an ex-solider whose face bore the map of many battlefields, and who
        earned a living as a guard. The years he walked a beat of Bowerstone were among the safest
        the town has ever known, but his repulsive appearance meant he never got the recognition he
        deserved.</string>
    <string name="homes_description_2">This was, for a short while, the home of Albert the Luminous,
        the man who would eventually find the Temple of Light. His stay in Bowerstone coincided with
        a very dark period of Albert\'s life, one which led him to the brink of despair. When he
        left on a pilgrimage, few thought that he would become the famous man that he did</string>
    <string name="homes_description_3">This was not only the house of one of the finest seamstresses
        in Albion, it is also the place where she created many of her most beautiful fashion
        designs. There is still an air of stylishness permeating the very walls</string>
    <string name="homes_description_4">Once the home of Alberta Givings, a woman of such generosity
        she could not help sharing whatever she had with those less fortunate than her. Food, gold
        and lodging could always be found here, but Alberta herself was so pure, not even the lowest
        scum in Bowerstone could bring themselves to take advantage of her, meaning that only the
        truly benefited from her kindness</string>
    <string name="homes_description_5">Alfred the Beggar may have been extremely poor, but as such a
        kind man he could always be counted on to do the right thing. Whenever there was a dispute,
        the law was called upon to resolve it, but it was Albert who would always know the fairest
        way to deal with any problem</string>
    <string name="homes_description_6">Once the home of one Johnny Scum,whose grotesque appearance
        drove people to conjecture that he must be the result of the union between a Hobbe and a
        Troll. Though not particularly evil, Johnny\'s corpulence inevitably led him to a life of
        crime, working as a heavy for many of Bowerstone\'s most important crime bosses</string>
    <string name="homes_description_7">Once owned by the Plimpington family, who counted amongst its
        members three of the most charming and good-looking people in Albion. Though the parents
        weren\'t much to look at, their son and two daughters turned heads wherever they went</string>
    <string name="homes_description_8">This was once the home of Lavender Nice, a woman as famous
        for her kindness as for her astounding beauty. Despite having hundreds of suitors, she was
        far too pure to marry. When she disappeared, still young enough to retain her looks, it was
        said that she had ascended to a higher plane of existence</string>
    <string name="homes_description_9">The residents of this wonderful house never seem to stay away
        very long but have traditionally been people of great importance and fame. Artists,
        adventurers and the very highest nobles have all called this place their home at one time or
        another</string>
    <string name="homes_description_10">The day alchemist Leo Head bought this house, the people of
        Bowerstone rejoiced, for they knew the renowned alchemist\'s inventions would benefit them
        all. Here he experimented with the potions that eventually led him to be wealthy enough to
        build what is known as Castle Fairfax</string>
    <string name="homes_description_11">Locals believe this house to be haunted by the spirit of a
        long-dead puffin. Rather than frightening its residents with nightmares however, the puffin
        is said to bring extremely peaceful and restful dreams</string>
    <string name="homes_description_12">This house is tainted by the many evil people who have lived
        here and has become famous for its association with dark deeds</string>
    <string name="homes_description_13">Better known for being the home of Brent Lightning, the
        fastest man ever to race through the roads of Albion. It is said he once threw a coin in the
        air here, did two laps of Bowerstone, and returned in time to catch it</string>
    <string name="homes_description_14">Once owned by Alan Mush, voted Ugliest Man in Albion, six
        years in a row. This house not only became to be known as The Ogre\'s Palace not just because
        of Alan's unusual facial features, but his enormous physique</string>
    <string name="homes_description_15">Jeff Lightning, whose brother and Albion speed record holder
        Brent lived on the same street, owned this house until his death. Though he possessed
        velocity comparable to Brent, Jeff suffered from a weak heart. Whenever he tried to match
        his brother in races, his irregular heartbeat took away a little bit more of his life until
        one day, there was no more left to take</string>

    <string name="landmark_name_8">Knothole Island</string>

    <string name="landmark_description_1">Rumoured to be the location of the old Heroes Guild, Bower
        Lake is a popular destination for travellers and locals. Located in the middle of Mirfield,
        Bower Lake is only a short walk away from the Gypsy Camp and is hard to miss on your way to
        Bowerstone</string>
    <string name="landmark_description_2">Separating the town entrance and popular marketplace, Bower
        Bridge has become the go to place for social gatherings and traders looking to sell to
        travellers. There are rumours that Bower Bridge is somehow related to the legendary Gargoyle
        Trove</string>
    <string name="landmark_description_3">Built on top of the former Bowerstone Manor, Castle
        Fairfax is easily the most spectacular of all Bowerstone landmarks. Civilians are free to
        roam the stunning gardens surrounding the castle, where you are likely to find locals
        selling the highest standard products. Although owned by the Fairfax family for generations,
        a transgender Elton John lookalike has recently been seen sitting upon the throne</string>
    <string name="landmark_description_4">At the heart of Bowerstone markets sits the clock tower.
        It is the popular meeting point for shoppers, dates, and even the occasional orgy. The town
        crier can often be seen staring at the clock face waiting to declare the time to the
        Square</string>
    <string name="landmark_description_5">This is the place you go to if you need anything. Well not
        anything, if you need to purchase something that is likely to be found in a bustling market
        town then this is the place to be. If not, buy something anyway and support our
        economy</string>
    <string name="landmark_description_6">No one knows where he came from, but the common assumption
        is that no mortal man could offer such wonderful products at such reasonable prices. Each
        purchase comes with the guarantee that it will change your life forever.  No refunds</string>
    <string name="landmark_description_7">Nothing is known about the origin of this statue, so I
        will have to make it up. The statue shows Sir Randy riding his trusty stead ‘Oinky’ into
        battle during the Great Bacon War. Show your respect to the statue by getting down on your
        knees and squealing like a pig. Locals may try to avoid you at this point, but it is just
        part of the tradition</string>
    <string name="landmark_description_8">If Bowerstone is not the place for you, we recommend
        taking your business elsewhere. Look for Gordon along the docks and ask him nicely to be
        taken to Knothole Island in his submarine</string>
